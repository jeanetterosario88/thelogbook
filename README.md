Overview:

This project builds the The How'd It Go? aka The Logbook: a site where a person can keep track of important interactions such as job interviews and auditions. 

This application implements two classes: Entry and User. A user cannot take any actions outside of signing up, unless they are logged in. Once a user is logged in, they can read, edit, create and delete their entries, and then log out.

Enjoy!
